3D reconsturtion app

Objective: take pictures from a room, then create a 3D model using an SfM pipeline locally on the mobil device.

In theory, the app calibrates the camera, finds and matches the features, then through triangulation creates a pointcloud.
Next surface reconstruction happens, alongisde texture mapping creating an exportable 3D model using a classic SfM structure.
